Segmenting is the process of converting a written word to a sequence of tokens.

This module provides functions to segment various kinds of text.

An alternative method to segment text - based on orthography profiles - is
implemented in the `segments` package.

    Segment IPA-encoded text.

    text : str
        The input sequence that shall be tokenized.

    diacritics : {iterable}
        A string containing all diacritics which shall be considered in the
        respective analysis.

    vowels : {iterable}
        A string containing all vowel symbols which shall be considered in the
        respective analysis.

    tones : {iterable}
        A string indicating all tone letter symbals which shall be considered
        in the respective analysis.

    combiners : str
        A string with characters that are used to combine two separate
        characters (compare affricates such as t͡s).

    breaks : str
        A string containing the characters that indicate that a new token
        starts right after them. These can be used to indicate that two
        consecutive vowels should not be treated as diphtongs or for diacritics
        that are put before the following letter.

    merge_vowels : bool (default=False)
        Indicate, whether vowels should be merged into diphtongs
        (default=True), or whether each vowel symbol should be considered
        separately.

    merge_geminates : bool (default=False)
        Indicate, whether identical symbols should be merged into one token, or
        rather be kept separate.

    expand_nasals : bool (default=False)

    semi_diacritics: str (default='')
        Indicate which symbols shall be treated as "semi-diacritics", that is,
        as symbols which can occur on their own, but which eventually, when
        preceded by a consonant, will form clusters with it. If you want to
        disable this features, just set the keyword to an empty string.

    clean_string : bool (default=False)
        Conduct a rough string-cleaning strategy by which all items between
        brackets are removed along with the brackets, and

    Returns
    -------
    tokens : list
        A list of IPA tokens.
